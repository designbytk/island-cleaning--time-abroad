    Please advise if you or any member of your household are exhibiting symptoms or have been in the last two weeks. If you are yet to arrive at your Nantucket summer residence, we would prefer to handle any interior cleaning needs a minimum of ONE WEEK prior to your arrival. Our technicians are all trained on dealing with emerging pathogens and have access to PPE and hospital-grade disinfectants, and are trained to use such according to IICRC guidelines. All workers report their temperature daily. New personal protective gear (gloves and shoe covers) will be worn on your property and will be properly disposed of and or sanitized. Masks will be on hand for properties with home owners present.
