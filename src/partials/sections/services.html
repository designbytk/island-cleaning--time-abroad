                <p class="long-desc">Outside of your range/oven, your dryer is the most likely appliance to cause a
                    fire. (Dryers cause over 15,000 fires a year.) Your dryer's lint screen, even when used properly,
                    only traps a percentage of dryer lint. The rest passes through your dryer vent system and
                    accumulates on the walls of the ducts or the inside of the dryer itself. This accumulation also
                    reduces the effectiveness of your dryer. Lower your bills and reduce your risk of fire. Have us come
                    and clean your dryer duct today!</p>
